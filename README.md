## AboutMe

I'm Joke, a Full Stack Software Developer from Belgium. I am a hard worker with a lot of attention to detail and I am always eager to learn and improve my skills.

I'm very creative, and when I'm not channeling that creativity into a project I love to knit, draw and write poems and stories.

I also love helping others. As such, I volunteered at CoderDojo Lier as a coach for a cool gang of young coders aged 7 to 18. I also held a position of Slack Channel Lead twice while I was studying. This was followed with four years as a tutor and instructor creating lessons for HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Python and Django. 

I'd love to find a similar position, passing on my knowledge to new coders through online learning, or a socially relevant software development position where I can help improve the lives of others through code.
