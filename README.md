## AboutMe
I'm Joke, a Junior Full Stack Software Developer from Belgium. I am a hard worker with a lot of attention to detail and I am always eager to learn and improve my skills.

I'm very creative, and when I'm not channeling that creativity into a project I love to knit, draw and write poems and stories.

I also love helping others grow their skills. As such, I volunteer at CoderDojo Lier as a coach for a cool gang of young coders aged 7 to 18. I also held a position of Slack Channel Lead twice while I was studying. I'm still active in the Code Institute community helping others even now I've graduated.

## FunFact
🧙‍♀️ I'm a complete Potterhead and was sorted into Hufflepuff House on Pottermore.

For me, programming is like magic with a keyboard instead of a wand. I'm loving it! 🤩
